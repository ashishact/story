The couple who saw her off were probably her parents; they seemed very anxious about her comfort, and the woman gave the girl detailed instructions as to where to keep her things, when not to lean out of windows, and how to avoid speaking to strangers. They called their goodbyes; and the train pulled out of the station.

                As I was totally blind at the
                time, my eyes sensitive only to light and darkness, I was unable to tell what the girl looked like; but I knew she wore slippers from the way they slapped against her heels. It would take me some time to discover something about her looks, and perhaps I never would. But I liked the sound of her voice, and even the sound of her slippers.

                Well, it often happens that people with good eyesight fail to see what is right in front of them. They have too much to take in, I suppose.

                I moved easily along the berth and felt for the window ledge. The window was open, and I faced it, making a pretence of studying the landscape. I heard the panting of the engine, the rumble of the wheels, and, in my mind's eye, I could see the telegraph posts flashing by.

                "You have an interesting face," I remarked. I was becoming quite daring, but it was a safe

                Yet I was prepared to sit there for almost any length of time, just to listen to her talking. Her voice had the sparkle of a mountain stream.

                The girl got up and began to collect her things. I wondered if she wore her hair in a bun, or if it was plaited. Perhaps it was hanging loose over her shoulders. Or was it cut very short?

            <div class="para">
                The train drew slowly into the station. Outside, there was the shouting of porters and vendors and a high-pitched female voice near the carriage door. That voice must have belonged to the girl's aunt.

                The guard blew his whistle and we moved off. Once again I had a game to play and a new
                fellow traveller.

            Why did the narrator pretend to be sighted?
            The narrator loved to pretend that he was not blind. He developed this habit since he had lost
            his sight.
            Why do you think that the narrator was glad to have the girl in his cabin?
            The narrator was glad to have the girl in his compartment because he had been traveling
            alone for quite a long time till Rohana. He was particularly attracted to beauty and beautiful
            people. Besides, his favourite pastime favourite being playing pranks with people by not
            revealing his blindness, he loved the girl’s entry.
            What does the narrator refer to by the mistake he committed?
            While in conversation with the girl, the narrator asked her how the landscape outside look
            like. It was a blunder on his side because this question would have stirred the girl’s
            suspicions. He had been pretending like an ordinary man with sight but this question was
            unusual on the side of a man with sight.
            What response from the girl dispel the narrator’s doubts that his secret had been
            noticed by her
            When the narrator asked the girl to describe the world outside, he was mostly certain that his
            foolish question would lead the girl to think that he was blind but she asked him why he
            could not look for himself and meant that the girl had not noticed his blindness.
            Why did the girl in fact ask the narrator why he could not look out and see the world
            outside?
            Like the narrator, the girl too was blind and was pretending to be able to see. Probably she
            didn’t want to give away with her blindness for her own safety, a safety for a blind young girl
            who could be easily targeted by someone on a train.
            How did the narrator further pretend to dispel the girl’s possible suspicions on him?
            Though the girl’s question, “why don’t you look out of the window” had almost dispelled the
            narrator’s fears that the girl had discovered his blindness, he went on pretending to be really
            sighted. Facing the open window, he remarked that trees appeared to be moving while they
            sat in the train. When he saw that it was a silly, childish remark which would have given him
            away, he went on affirming that there were no animal on the hills.
            Why was the narrator certain that there were no animals on the hills?
    
            The narrator was certain that there were no animals to be seen if the girl were testing him
            because he had heard that deforestation had wiped all the animals from the hills near
            Dehradun.
            Why was the narrator sure that his remark that the girl had an interesting face was a
            safe one?
            The narrator openly remarked that the girl had an interesting face and he knew for sure that
            the girl would definitely like it – few girls can resist flattery when it is about their beauty.
            How did the girl return the narrator’s flattery?
            The girl was pleased by the narrator’s remark and laughed out loudly accepting his remark.
            She paid him back for the good words said about her by returning a similar remark about him
            as being a gallant young man.
            Why did the narrator subdue his attempt to laugh for the girl?
            The narrator was only happy to laugh for the girl who complained that he was a serious
            character. When he thought of laughing, instantly the thought of losing the pretty, vibrant girl
            at another station hit him hard. He felt like a philosopher who meditates on the transient
            happiness and meeting.
            The new passenger who got in at Saharanpur and the narrator differed in terms of their
            looking at things. Explain.
            A male passenger got in at Saharanpur Station where the girl had got down. The man, on
            entering the train, noticed the girl’s eyes and sadly noticed that those eyes were blind. Being a
            blind man himself, the narrator had failed to learn that the girl was as blind as he was.
            What leaves the reader spellbound at the end of the story?
            Ruskin Bond kept the pulse of the reader high with the narrator’s attempts to escape the
            chances of his being caught by the girl’s smart questions and remarks. When she asks him
            why he could not look out for himself or when he gave her a start from the dark corner of the
            compartment, he had to end his dramatic show but chances favoured him. The reader realizes
            that it was not the girl that the narrator had been fooling but it was the reader that the author
            had just fooled and that realization leaves the reader spellbound.
            The narrator had a personality so much different from the girl’s. What make the two
            different?
            Apart from their similarity in guarding their blindness from each other, the two passengers
            were different. The narrator was a piece of butter ready to apply on a pretty girl. He was a
            romantic fool who was ready to believe a girl by her ringing laughter and vibrant voice. He
            was not altogether decent. A pervert who craves women and her company, ready to travel to
            the end of the earth for the pleasure of sharing his cabin with a seemingly beautiful girl, he
    
            exhibits a very base passion for lust. On the other hand, the girl was not glad to travel another
            mile to enjoy a stranger’s company. She was well brought up and was wise.
